# Speech-to-Text Translation with Real-time Language Conversion

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system that can convert speech to text and then translate the text into a different language in real time. This system leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate and efficient speech recognition and language translation services.

## Features

- **Real-time Speech Recognition:** Converts spoken language into text with high accuracy.
- **Instant Language Translation:** Translates the recognized text into a target language in real time.
- **Multilingual Support:** Supports multiple languages for both speech recognition and translation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction.
